## installation
- `npm i` install dependecncies
- `npm run dev`  start project
- `npm run build` build project

## my notes
- Responsive Breakpoint base on tailwind css , not vuetify.
- In package.json in build script add `--base=/` with time protection. Enter the path directly and the page is blank.
